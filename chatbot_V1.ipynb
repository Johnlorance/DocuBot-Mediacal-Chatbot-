Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection.\n\nOsteoarthritis also causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. If cartilage in a joint is severely damaged, the joint lining may become inflamed and swollen.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint.\n\nRisk factors\n\nRisk factors for arthritis include:\n\nFamily history. Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder.\n\nSome types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder. Age. The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age.\n\nThe risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age. Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men. Previous joint injury. People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint.\n\nPeople who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint. Obesity. Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis.\n\nComplications\n\nSevere arthritis, particularly if it affects your hands or arms, can make it difficult for you to do daily tasks. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight. In some cases, joints may gradually lose their alignment and shape.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Tokinization\ntext = corpus\nsentence_list = nltk.sent_tokenize(text) #
